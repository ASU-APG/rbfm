    <h1 class="page-heading">Introduction</h1>
    <p>In 2025, multimodal AI has evolved dramatically, with foundation models now seamlessly integrating text, images,
        video, and audio to create more human-like understanding and generation capabilities. As these technologies
        continue to transform industries from healthcare to creative arts, the need for responsible development has
        never been more critical. Recent advancements in multimodal adaptation and generalization have opened new
        possibilities while simultaneously presenting complex challenges that require proactive solutions.</p>

    <p>The landscape of multimodal AI has fundamentally shifted since our last workshop. Major players like OpenAI,
        Google, and Meta have heavily invested in multimodal capabilities, with breakthrough models like GPT-4o, SORA,
        Imagen, and Veo2 generating
        realistic images and videos from text, Meta's SeamlessM4T translating speech and text in real time, and many
        more are
        processing and integrating multiple data types simultaneously. These advancements have accelerated adoption
        across industries, with Gartner estimating that 40% of generative AI offerings will be multimodal by 2027, up
        from just 1% in 2023.</p>


    <p>Our workshop aims to provide a platform for the community to establish responsible design principles for the next
        generation of multimodal foundation models. This year's goals include::
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Explore novel design principles</b> emphasizing responsibility and sustainability in multimodal
            generative models, aiming to reduce their extensive data and computational demands.</li>
        <li>Establishing best practices for <b>controllability evaluation</b> that go beyond general-purpose scores to
            assess
            fundamental skills across modalities.</li>
        <li>Exploring <b>multimodal test-time adaptation</b> and domain generalization techniques that enhance model
            reliability across diverse real-world scenarios.</li>
        <li>Developing frameworks for <b>responsible agentic multimodal systems</b> that can safely operate with greater
            autonomy while maintaining human oversight in critical decisions.</li>
        <li>Enhance the <b>robustness against adversarial</b> and backdoor attacks, thereby
            securing their integrity in adversarial environments.</li>
        <li>Identify the sources of reliability concerns, whether they stem from data quality, model
            architecture, or pre-training strategies.</li>
    </ul>
